This tutorial by the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute]({{ site.molssi_site }}) (MolSSI)
overviews the fundamentals of heterogeneous parallel programming based on 
[data-parallel C++ (DPC++)](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/data-parallel-c-plus-plus.html),
[Khronos Group's SYCL industry standards](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/) and [Intel's oneAPI](https://www.oneapi.io/) 
which offer a unified approach for parallel programming across multiple processor/accelerator architectures.


The MolSSI's full education mission statement can be found [here](http://molssi.org/education/education-mission-statement/).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> - Previous knowledge of High-performance Computing (HPC) basic concepts are helpful but not required for starting this course.
Nevertheless, we encourage students to take a glance at our [Parallel Programming](https://education.molssi.org/parallel-programming)
tutorial, specifically, Chapters 1, 2 and 5 for a brief overview of some of the fundamental concepts in HPC.
> - Basic familiarity with Bash, C and C++ programming languages (in particular, C++17 standard) is required.
> - [MolSSI's Fundamentals of Heterogeneous Parallel Programming with CUDA C/C++ at the beginner level](http://education.molssi.org/gpu_programming_beginner)
is not a pre-requisite for the present tutorial, but familiarity with the fundamental concepts of CUDA programming models would
be extremely helpful towards full comprehension of the analogies and connections made during the workshop.
